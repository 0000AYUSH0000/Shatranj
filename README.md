# SHATRANJ

I developed Shatranj, a chess app using Flutter with cool features to enhance the chess-playing experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Chessboard**: An 8x8 chessboard with draggable pieces for seamless gameplay.
- **Move Validation**: Validates each move according to standard chess rules.
- **Check & Checkmate Detection**: Alerts players when their king is in check or checkmate.
- **Pawn Promotion**: Promotes pawns to queens, rooks, bishops, or knights when they reach the opposite end.
- **Game Reset**: Resets the game to its initial state for a fresh start.
- **Turn Indicator**: Displays whose turn it is to play, preventing confusion.

## Overview
